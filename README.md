# Buried

The engine is actually called LunarEngine2D but the name Buried is mostly for historical reasons as at the beginning it was supposted to be used for a game called that way.

This project was started when I was about 15 and I spent my whole summer holidays working on it. The technology it used is now kinda deprecated. I coded it all by myself and it was a milestone in my programming career as I realized that big does not always mean useful. After abandoning LunarEngine2D I fosued on coding tiny but sophisticated projects instead of massive but made in 80% of glue code. However, LunarEngine2D provided my with incredible experience on designing project architecure.  

The game engine is divied into 3 parts. Two main parts:  net.swing.* and net.editor.* .Both are in src folder. The third part from srcAI is not directly part of engine. It's more of a playground for testing stuff before they actually get added to engine itself.

Originally this project has been hosted for years on a different github account (initially I planned on sharing access to that account but in the end it was never necesary) but now I decided to migrate it to my main account. All commits history will be lost but hey! Who cares anyway?

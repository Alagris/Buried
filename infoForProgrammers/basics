BASICS:
0.If you are new take your time and study code. You should start in folder src:
	- net.BuriedMain
	- net.swing.src.env.WorldSettings
Folder srcAI is not part of game. Code there is used for testing AI that is very early in development.
Feel free to add necessary comment. They will help other new 
people to understand everything better and study code faster.
Mind that not everyone here is a native English speaker,
so if you are one and you find some language mistakes feel free to
correct them.  

1.Before you start coding make sure that files that you want to use
 aren't already being used by someone else.Then post an information
 in Programmer's Haven on HipChat. You should declare:
	-which source folder you work in (if there are many of them)
	-which package (or packages) you are going to use
	-what you are going to change,add,remove etc. (e.g. fixing AI of a particular entity)
2.When you finish and debug code, upload it to remote repository. Information about it will be posted automatically
3.When you work on something try make changes only in those packages that you declared to use 
4.You really shouldn't make any changes in packages (at least classes) that are used by another programmer at the moment.
5.If you need to break 3rd rule at first contact the programmer that works with those files
6.If you find conflicts in files merge them but don't erase any line of code (just comment them and put //MERGED above those lines) so nopony will loose work
7.From time to time we are going to organize "debugging days" which  
means that everyone finishes what he/she is doing and synchronizes 
code. Then all programmers try to remove/change every possible loop, variable 
or even whole method to make code cleaner and working faster. We will
especially pay attention to tags //MERGED and //FIXME. It's also a good time
to add some necessary comments.


PROGRAMMING IN THE SAME FILES:
-if you want to code the same thing with another programmer it's good to communicate in real time (e.g.via Skype). It's useful when you have a problem that you cannot solve on your own.
-use this link http://cosketch.com/Rooms/tceksws to plan or/and share your ideas with other programmers
 
 
GOOD HABITS:
-synchronize your files with git repository as often as possible
-don't push code to git repository until you are sure that it doesn't contain any major bugs
-keep high performance and measure your algorithms with Test class (net.swing.src.data.Test)
-try not to use static classes (classes with all methods being static) until its needed
-always plan algorithm before you start coding it
-try not to use IndexOutOfBoundsException. There is a faster way: AImath.validateIndex();
-just remember these simple rules and everything will be fine:
	-max performance
	-min variables and loops
	-universal methods
	-huge comments	(if you see that somewhere are not enough comments you can add or modify them)
